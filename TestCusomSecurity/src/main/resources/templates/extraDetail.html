		  <p>This is a refund policy for purchases made during sale events, as well as regular purchases. Orders made during sale events are final, and items cannot be returned for a refund, while items purchased with a discount of 50% or higher are final sales and cannot be returned for exchange or refund.</p>
		  <p>For regular purchases, the Returns policy lasts for 14 days. After this period, returns cannot be accepted unless a product is faulty. To be eligible for a return, the item must be unused and in its original packaging.</p>
		  <p>Customers will be responsible for paying all shipping costs, import duties, customs, and taxes for returning goods to the UK-based Returns Hub. If customers wish to exchange a pair of shoes for a different size, color, or style, the new shipment will be sent back with pre-paid customs duties.</p>
		  <p>Once the return is received and inspected, customers will be notified of the approval or rejection of their refund. If approved, the refund will be processed within 7 working days and credited back to the original method of payment.</p>
